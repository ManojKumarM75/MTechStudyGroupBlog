the google sheet is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BQd1VeueJ5cVrox9Am06toW7VQB9nQv-Wtjw_IkTIDI/edit?usp=sharing
The script which puts the folder structure into sheet as required table is kept seperate in the scripts project - FileNamesToGSheet, this particular gs code is inside that folder , name -Main_FileFoldersNames_To_TableModelConvert   : https://script.google.com/home/projects/1Cit0amhQCU_qHNpCEju2cCO1kS1wpH9fvQKs9lqVLzgA2y2Peg8UQBSy/edit
The script generating API is bound to the sheet. Earlier I kept is separate, but after changing the sheet, it stopped working, even after several recreation of API deployment web app links.
